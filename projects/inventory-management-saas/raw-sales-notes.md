## Raw Notes from Discovery Call

Spoke with Mike Thompson (VP Operations) and Jennifer Liu (IT Director)

They have 8 retail locations + online store. Currently using mix of Excel spreadsheets and old POS system from 2015. Mike mentioned they're losing about $50K/month from stockouts and overordering. Big pain point.

Jennifer said their IT team is small - just 3 people. They need something that won't require heavy maintenance. Cloud-based is a must. Security is important - had a breach 2 years ago, very sensitive about it now.

Budget discussion - Mike hinted at around $3-5K/month for the right solution. Need to get CFO approval for anything over $3K. Decision timeline: Q2 implementation ideal, but could push to Q3 if needed.

Competition - they're also talking to InventoryPro and StockMaster. Mike likes our multi-location sync feature better. Jennifer worried about our API capabilities for integration with their existing ecommerce platform (Shopify Plus).

Key requirements they mentioned:
- Real-time inventory across all locations
- Predictive ordering based on seasonality
- Barcode scanning via mobile app
- Integration with Shopify Plus and their current POS
- Role-based access control
- Automated reorder points
- Supplier management portal

Pain points with current system:
- Takes 6 hours every week just to reconcile inventory
- Lost a major sale last month - couldn't fulfill large B2B order
- Employees frustrated with manual counts
- No visibility into other store inventory
- Can't track inventory in transit between locations

Next steps: 
- They want a demo focusing on multi-location features
- Need technical deep dive with Jennifer's team
- Mike wants ROI calculations
- Follow up meeting scheduled for Jan 22

Other notes:
- Company growing 30% YoY
- Planning to open 3 more locations this year
- Considering international expansion 2026
- Mike is the real decision maker but needs Jennifer's technical approval
- CFO (Robert) will need to sign off but usually follows Mike's lead
- They have a good relationship with current POS vendor, don't want to change that
