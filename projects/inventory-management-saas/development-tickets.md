# Development Tickets - RetailFlow MVP

Based on Product Planning Meeting from January 20, 2025

## Context

RetailFlow needs a working prototype by mid-February demonstrating multi-location inventory sync with their NCR Counterpoint POS system. The primary goal is proving we can prevent their $50K/month stockout losses. Initial pilot with 2 stores, expanding to all 8 locations.

## Ticket #1: NCR Counterpoint POS Integration - Read Operations

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days  
**Type:** Feature  
**Assigned to:** Jordan

### Description
Implement read-only integration with NCR Counterpoint REST API to fetch current inventory levels, product data, and store information. This is the foundation for all sync operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully authenticate with NCR Counterpoint API

- [ ] Retrieve current inventory levels for all locations
- [ ] Handle API rate limits (100 calls/minute) with exponential backoff
- [ ] Map NCR data model to our internal schema
- [ ] Document all API endpoints used

### Technical Notes
- Use axios with retry logic for API calls
- Implement caching layer with Redis (5-minute TTL)
- Create abstraction layer for POS interface to support future systems
- Rate limiter should queue requests when approaching limits
- Consider NCR's poor documentation - may need to test endpoints manually
