# Hypothesis Prioritization - TechSupport Pro AI Support Platform

**Generated by:** hypothesis-identifier agent  
**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Project:** AI-Powered Customer Support Augmentation

## Primary Hypothesis

**If we** build an AI that accurately suggests responses for support agents within their existing Zendesk workflow **then** B2B SaaS companies with 10+ agents **will** reduce average response time by 75% and improve agent satisfaction **so we can** prove our core value of augmenting humans rather than replacing them while preventing the 15% churn TechSupport Pro faces.

## Risk Assessment & Priority

### 🔴 Highest Risk: Accuracy Trust (Desirability)
**Assumption:** Support agents will trust AI suggestions after their previous bad chatbot experience  
**Why Critical:** Lisa already has trust issues from past AI failures - one wrong answer could kill the deal  
**Test Method:** Run 1,000 real tickets through our system, measure accuracy, have agents score quality  

### 🔴 Highest Risk: Integration Friction (Feasibility)
**Assumption:** We can seamlessly embed into Zendesk without disrupting agent workflow  
**Why Critical:** Any added friction will cause agents to bypass the system entirely  
**Test Method:** Build Zendesk plugin prototype, measure time-to-response with and without AI  

### 🟡 High Risk: Adoption Resistance (Behavioral)
**Assumption:** Agents will actually use AI suggestions rather than ignore them  
**Why Critical:** Value only realized if agents change behavior to leverage AI  
**Test Method:** 2-week pilot tracking suggestion acceptance rate and modification patterns  

### 🟡 High Risk: Knowledge Ingestion Quality (Velocity)
**Assumption:** We can effectively train on their 2,000+ knowledge articles and product docs  
**Why Critical:** Generic AI won't work - must understand their specific product  
**Test Method:** Ingest subset of docs, test comprehension with product-specific questions  

### 🟢 Medium Risk: Multi-language Support (Viability)
**Assumption:** Spanish language support will maintain same accuracy as English  
**Why Critical:** 30% of customers need Spanish support  
**Test Method:** Parallel testing with bilingual support agents

## Success Metrics & Kill Criteria

### Success Indicators (End of Sprint 3):
✅ 95%+ accuracy on product-specific questions  
✅ 60%+ AI suggestion acceptance rate  
✅ 50%+ reduction in average response time  
✅ 5+ point CSAT score improvement  
✅ Zero critical errors (wrong technical instructions)  
✅ 80%+ agent satisfaction with the tool  

### Kill Criteria (Stop if these occur):
❌ Accuracy below 90% on their content  
❌ Agent adoption below 30% after training  
❌ Zendesk integration adds >2 seconds delay  
❌ Any AI response causes customer harm  
❌ Spanish support accuracy <85%  
❌ Data residency requirements can't be met  

## What We're NOT Testing

- Full automation without human review
- Voice support integration
- Customer-facing chatbot
- Integration with phone systems
- AI-generated knowledge base articles
- Predictive ticket prevention

## Key Insights from Research

1. **Previous failure creates higher bar** - Must over-deliver on accuracy to overcome skepticism
2. **Agent augmentation resonates** - They don't want to replace humans, just help them
3. **Speed matters more than features** - Response time is primary KPI
4. **Knowledge quality is crucial** - Their content is technical and specific
5. **Change management is critical** - 12 agents with varying tech comfort levels

## Strategic Positioning

**Our Wedge:** "The only AI that makes your best agent's knowledge available to every agent, instantly"

**NOT:** "Replace your support team with AI" (they explicitly don't want this)  
**NOT:** "Another chatbot" (they've been burned)  
**BUT:** "Turn every agent into your best agent with AI-powered intelligence"

## Testing Methodology Details

### Week 1-2: Accuracy Testing Protocol
```
1. Ingest knowledge base subset (100 articles)
2. Run 1,000 historical tickets through system
3. Generate suggested responses
4. Have senior agents score suggestions (1-5)
5. Flag any incorrect technical information
6. Calculate accuracy percentage and confidence intervals
```

### Week 3-4: Integration Testing
```
1. Deploy Zendesk sandbox environment
2. Install prototype plugin
3. Measure baseline metrics (current response times)
4. Process 50 tickets with AI assistance
5. Measure new response times
6. Calculate time saved per ticket
```

### Week 5-6: Behavioral Testing
```
1. Two agents use system for all tickets
2. Track:
   - Suggestion acceptance rate
   - Modification patterns
   - Bypass frequency
   - Time to comfort
3. Daily surveys on satisfaction
4. Weekly optimization based on feedback
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

**If accuracy is below target:**
- Add human-in-the-loop for low confidence responses
- Implement "learning mode" where agents correct AI
- Focus on high-confidence subset of queries first

**If integration is too complex:**
- Build standalone dashboard as fallback
- Offer copy-paste interface initially
- Partner with Zendesk for deeper integration

**If agents resist adoption:**
- Gamify usage with accuracy competitions
- Show personal time savings dashboard
- Start with voluntary adoption, prove value

**If Spanish support lags:**
- Partner with translation service initially
- Hire Spanish-speaking QA team
- Offer English-only for pilot, Spanish in Phase 2

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Request 1,000 anonymized tickets from TechSupport Pro
   - Begin knowledge base ingestion
   - Start Zendesk API integration research

2. **Sprint 1 Kickoff:**
   - Schedule agent shadowing sessions
   - Set up Zendesk sandbox
   - Build accuracy testing framework

3. **Stakeholder Communication:**
   - Share testing plan with David and Lisa
   - Get commitment for 2 pilot agents
   - Agree on success metrics
