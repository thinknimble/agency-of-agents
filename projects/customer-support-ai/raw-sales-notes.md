Prospect: TechSupport Pro (B2B SaaS Company)

## Raw Meeting Notes

Call with David Chen (VP Customer Success) and Lisa Martinez (Head of Support Operations)

TechSupport Pro - they provide project management software to construction companies. 3,500 customers, growing 40% YoY. Support team drowning - 12 agents handling 500+ tickets daily. Average response time is 8 hours, customers complaining.

David mentioned they're losing customers - churn up 15% last quarter mainly due to poor support experience. Big problem: 60% of tickets are repetitive questions about same features. Agents spending time answering "how do I export a report" 50 times a day.

Lisa frustrated with current helpdesk (Zendesk) - no AI features in their plan, would cost extra $30K/year to upgrade. They want something that integrates with Zendesk but provides AI automation. Budget around $5-8K/month for the right solution.

Current pain points:
- Agents burnout from repetitive questions
- No 24/7 coverage (customers in 3 timezones)
- Knowledge base exists but customers don't use it
- No way to automatically categorize and route tickets
- Escalation process is manual and slow
- Can't identify trending issues quickly
- No sentiment analysis on angry customers
- Agents need to search multiple systems for answers

What they want:
- AI that can answer common questions automatically
- Suggested responses for agents on complex tickets
- Automatic ticket categorization and routing
- Sentiment analysis to flag urgent/angry customers
- Knowledge base that actually helps (AI-powered search)
- Integration with their Zendesk, Slack, and Confluence
- Ability to train AI on their specific product documentation
- Analytics on what customers are asking about
- Multi-language support (30% customers speak Spanish)

Competition: Looking at Intercom (too expensive at $15K/month), Freshdesk AI (doesn't integrate well), and considering building in-house (no resources).

David likes our approach of augmenting agents rather than replacing them. Lisa concerned about AI accuracy - had bad experience with chatbot giving wrong answers before.

Technical requirements:
- Must integrate with Zendesk via API
- Need to ingest their 2,000+ knowledge base articles
- Should work with their existing Slack workflow
- Data must stay in US (compliance requirement)
- Need audit trail for all AI interactions
- Want ability to override/correct AI responses

Timeline: Q2 implementation critical - big customer conference in June, need success story. Can start pilot with 2 agents immediately.

Next steps:
- Technical demo focusing on Zendesk integration
- POC with their actual tickets (they'll share 1000 anonymized samples)
- Security review with their IT team
- Pilot program proposal for 2 agents

Other notes:
- Company raised Series B ($45M) last year
- Planning IPO in 2-3 years
- David is decision maker but needs Lisa's buy-in
- CFO already approved budget if ROI is clear
- They measure success by: response time, resolution time, CSAT scores
- Current CSAT is 72%, target is 85%+
- Agent retention is also a KPI (losing 2-3 agents per quarter)
