## Primary Needs & Pain Points

   - Show potential automation rate and time savings
   - Calculate specific ROI based on their metrics

3. **Security & Compliance Package**

4. **Pilot Program Structure**
   - 30-day pilot with 2 agents

5. **ROI Analysis**

## Hypothesis for Testing

**If we can demonstrate** 60% automated resolution on repetitive tickets with >95% accuracy **then TechSupport Pro** will expand from pilot to full implementation **because** we directly address their agent burnout while improving customer satisfaction **enabling them** to scale support operations for IPO without linear cost increases.

- Start with internal agent assistance before customer-facing

## Critical Success Factors

1. Must show immediate impact in pilot (within 2 weeks)
